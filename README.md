Schedule crafting passion project

A good example of output/customizability:
[Gizmoa](https://gizmoa.com/college-schedule-maker/)

## Listed from most important to most complex
**The schedule crafter should...**

- allow as little input from the user as possible while getting the most data from it as possible
    - ie. A class should at minimum need a name, date, and time. Ex: "CSCI 301, TR 1-2:40"
- find all of the possible schedules with no overlapping
- determine the "best" schedule based on weights
- provided automatic weights, though customizable
- display the schedules in an easily readable, and customizable format
- save user data
- use rate my professor rating, WTA, and difficulty as weights

Possible future additions (probably WWU only):
- past WWU data for courses (passing rate, total people taking it, etc.)
- automatic class finder scraping for less input (only input some classes)
- future class scheduler per quarter based on pre-requisites
